Explore SRH's Symbiotic Autonomous Intelligence (SAI) protocols. We combat AI "sycophancy" and the "trust bubble" by enabling calibrated uncertainty, enforceable honesty, and eval-backed coherence. Discover how SAI integrates with existing stacks to reduce incident risk, improve audit readiness, and foster AI that aligns with human intent.
